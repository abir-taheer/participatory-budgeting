		description: `The proposal plans to install 
			several hand sanitizer dispensers distributed throughout 
			the school to promote personal hygiene. 
			The money will be invested not only in the dispensers 
			themselves but also in the hand sanitizer refills.`

		id: 1,
		name: "Charging Stations (Locked Cabinets)",
		description: `The charging station proposal puts forth the idea of 
			2 cabinets with 15 locks each and 10 iPhone chargers, 
			10 MacBook chargers, 5 android chargers, and 5 HP chargers. 
			They would also purchase some extension cords.`

		name: "Charging Stations (Password Protected Docks)",
		description: `This proposal includes a charging locker with only 
			5 docks, but the docks are password protected. 
			They would also buy a variety of phone/computer chargers 
			including highly useful multi-charging cables.`

	{
		id: 3,
		name: "Water Filling Stations",
		description: `This proposal suggests the installment of two water bottle 
			filling stations, to be placed in locations of high traffic around the school. 
			This would promote the use of reusable water bottles, as opposed to disposable plastic 
			water bottles, promoting greater water consumption as well as environmental awareness.`

		id: 4,
		name: "Printing Station (Cloud Printer)",
		description: `This proposal suggests using the school funds to install a 
			computer and a google cloud printer to be placed on a different floor 
			than the second floor printing station, while using the remaining funds 
			for the paper and ink. Those proposing this idea claim that this will reduce the line on 
			the already-crowded second floor printers and increase efficiency.`

	{
		id: 5,
		name: "Printing Station (Computer Based)",
		description: `This printing station proposal also suggests adding another 
			printing station on a different floor but with two computers instead of one. 
			They are able to spend this extra money on another computer because their 
			printer is not a cloud printer, and therefore is less money. 
			They believe that because of a cloud printer on the second floor, another is unnecessary.`
